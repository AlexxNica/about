Welcome to WebExtensions Experiments
===================================

WebExtensions are becoming the cross-browser standard for developing add-ons in Firefox. 

WebExtensions Experiments allow developers to write experimental WebExtensions APIs for Firefox add-ons. They can be used to prototype APIs for landing in Firefox, or for use on `Nightly <https://nightly.mozilla.org/>`_ or `Developer Edition <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Developer_Edition>`_.

If you want to land a WebExtensions API in Firefox and are familiar with building `mozilla-central <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Introduction>`_, working with `Bugzilla <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/>`_, the `try server <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try>`_, and other Mozilla infrastructure, then WebExtensions Experiments is for you.

If you simply want to request a WebExtensions API, please file a bug `here <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Toolkit&component=WebExtensions>`_. These will be triaged and processed in a `bi-weekly public meeting <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Contribute/Triage>`_.
